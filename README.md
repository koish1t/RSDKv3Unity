# RSDKv3Unity

 A port of the XNA/WP7 port of Sonic CD to Unity. 

 Rendering is kinda wonky but I don't care enough to fix it rn. If you wanna fork it and fix it go ahead. (Make a PR after please, it'd be awesome sauce if you did!)

 Just open SampleScene.unity and run it, it'll automatically work since I included the Data.rsdk file.
